How to use:
Click the run/debug button in VSCode, and wait for the localhost URL to open in your browser. When it does, copy and paste it into an API platform like Postman,
or just continue viewing it in your browser. Either way, type "/EightBall/shake" (with that same casing) on the end of the localhost URL, and hit enter. It should display a randomized
response from the API, which will change whenever you refresh or hit enter.
