How to use:
Click the run/debug button in VSCode, and wait for the localhost URL to open in your browser. When it does, look in the debug console in VSCode and find the URL that starts with HTTP rather than HTTPS. When you find it, copy and paste it into an API platform like Postman, and type "/EightBall/shake" (with that same casing) on the end of the localhost URL. When you hit Enter, it should display a randomized response from the API, which will change whenever you refresh or hit enter.
